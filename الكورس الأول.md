# lesson 6

What is a bit?

a bit is the smallest unit of storage it can hold only binary state of 0 or 1 

What is a Crumb?

a group of 2 bits

What is a Nibble?

a group of 4 bits (half a byte)

What is a Byte?

a group of 8 bits

How many bits in a byte?

8 bits 

How many crumbs in a byte?

4 crumbs because each crumb is 2 bits and the byte is 8 bits 

How many nibbles in a byte?

2 nibbles because one nibble is 4 bits 

How many crumbs in a nibble?

2 crumbs each crumb is 2 bits and one nibble is 4 bits

What is the lower nibble?

it's the nibble on the right side of the byte and it has the smallest values of a byte 

What is the upper nibble?

it's the nibble on the left side of the byte and it has the biggest values of a byte 

What is LSB? And why we call it LSB? What it's value?

the LSB means Lowest significant bit and its the bit that has the first value in a byte its at the right side of the byte 

this bit has the smallest value

What is MSB? And why we call it MSB? What it's value?


the MSB means Biggest significant bit and its the bit that has the last value in a byte its at the left side of the byte 


this bit has the biggest value

## what are network types?

### Lan

local area network 

it's a group of ==nearby== connected devices 


lan can have from few devices to hundreds of devices like in schools or hospitals 

large organizations can have multiple lan networks maybe one per building 


#### Connection types 


wired
using wires or cables with ==Ethernet==
